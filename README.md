Parts for an 84mm Victorinox Swiss Army Knife (SAK)

Reference this thread: http://forum.multitool.org/index.php/topic,43271.0.html

The goal was to add Wenger scissors to an 84mm Victorinox.  In the process, a few other components were modeled in STL.

Custom 2.25mm pivots were fashioned by grinding down some brass rod to 2.25mm and then drilling and tapping for a 0-80 screw. (3/16" flat head 0-80 stainless screws.)

The only issue is that the pad of the original victorinox back spring is a little too big by 0.5mm-0.7mm or os.  Hence, the back spring sticks out just a tad when closed.
